I wanted to implement the basics of the components we want to create:
1. Convert NL to LTL formulas.
2. Generate a set of possible action sequences using product MDPs by converting LTL to Buchi Automaton (Found libraries (spot) that can do this).
3. Verify the trajectories in the planning stage against LTL (this seems more straightforward).
